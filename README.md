I've been trying to learn react which has been fun but challenging.

I'm following along the 'Road to learn React' tutorial. I'm basically taking it slow and trying to comprehend the reasoning for each step taken.
It's definitely been challenging and taking a lot of time but I can already tell I'm making progress.
This has been a huge help for getting my feet wet with es2016. I'm very comfortabel with arrow functions and from going over other resources I understand the `this` implications.

I also switched to VS Code for this project and I'm definitely enjoying it. THe integrated terminal is awesome and the program is fast so far. I was having issues with Sublime Text and JSX syntac highlighting but with Code everything is working perfectly. 

I do wish there was tabs for seperate terminals but that would add basically nothing to my workflow. I sometimes like watching the readout for sass to check for errors but that's only one window I need. Quickly having access to another to create a file or use git commands would be nice.

The biggest benefits from this project (besides learning react) will be:
  1. getting more familiar with es2016
  2. learning functional programming and higher order functions
  3. keeping data immutable

I'm sure there's more but so far this has been a great experience. It was extremely tough at first but after making progress I've figured out the pacing and what to expect. I can't wait to start creating apps from scratch. A todo list will most likely be my first original react project.
